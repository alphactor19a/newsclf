Hailing from the Trogneux family, renowned for their chocolate business, she accumulated wealth through inheritance and real estate, including the valuable Villa Monéjan.A viral video of France's First Lady, Brigitte Macron, appearing to gently shove President Emmanuel Macron before stepping off a presidential plane has rekindled public fascination with their relationship. While Macron dismissed the moment as playful -- \"I was bickering, or rather joking, with my wife\" -- it reignited curiosity about the couple's dynamic, their 25-year age gap, and Brigitte herself. So, who is the woman beside France's president -- and how much is she worth?\n",

Today, the family enterprise continues under her nephew Jean-Alexandre Trogneux, producing around two million macarons annually across France.\n",

      "Brigitte began her professional life as a literature teacher in the 1980s, later teaching French and Latin at Lycée la Providence in Amiens. It was there she met a 15-year-old Emmanuel Macron, then her student and classmate of her daughter. Though controversial, their relationship would evolve over time, with the couple marrying in 2007. She later taught at Lycée Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Paris until 2015.\n",

The bots infiltrated the subreddit r/ChangeMyView, which has nearly four million members and exists to facilitate civil debates on controversial topics. Over time, these AI agents posted more than 1,700 comments while posing as real users, ranging from a male rape survivor minimising trauma to a black man criticising Black Lives Matter. None of the subreddit users were told the posts were created by artificial intelligence.\n",

The draft noted that the bots were between three and six times more persuasive than human commenters, gauged through Reddit's award system for changed opinions.\n",

But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,\" Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said in an earnings call.\n",
